Well this is easy so, what you have to do is store all the edges with their weight in an array of struct Node sort them acc
to edges weight now keep connecting the two nodes if they belongs to diff component this can be done easily by disjoint set
with the help of union and findPar function as you take the edge in your mst keep a array of pair<int,int> and maintain all
the connected edges
